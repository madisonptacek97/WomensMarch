            <h4>TAGS</h4><p>&#35;anxiety</p>
        
            <p>My anxiety is undiagnosed and untreated. The only people that know about it are my roomates and my sister. I feel that I can’t tell my parents because I don’t want to dissapoint and worry them. My sister was diagnosed with OCD two years ago and it made them doubt their ability as parents and bring to front their own mental weaknesses.</p>
                
             <p>I steadily ignored my anxiety by going online and wasting time on apps so that I could distract myself from what I needed to do. I became obsessed with my phone and felt that I didn’t have enough time to do anything and could’t accomplish anything. I procrastinated until the last minute on all my tasks and eventually started to not be able to finish things.</p>
                
                <p>Eventually, after two years, I mentally broke down and finally told my sister that I had dropped classes and couldn’t go to work. Telling her really helped me acknowledge that I have anxiety. And for the last year I have been trying to go to class, graduate, work and figure out my life.</p>
                
                 <p>Right now I am trying to make permanent changes in order to live with my anxiety. I cut out unhealthy food, am trying to exercise, and have gotten off social media. I finally think that I am going to ask my doctor for medicine to help and going to tell my parents. It took me this long to get to this point because I didn’t want to be viewed as weak. I didn’t want to be viewed as a failure to my parents and to society. I finally realized that what I worried about didn’t really matter and that my “failures” were just a part of life.</p>

            <h4>JASMINE BROWN</h4>
            <p>I was afraid to tell anyone about my anxiety too. Eventually I opened up to my brother about it. After telling him, I now feel like I can start telling others.</p>
